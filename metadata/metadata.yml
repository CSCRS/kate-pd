name: 'KATE-PD: Kahramanmaraş Türkiye Earthquake-Post Disaster Dataset'
description: This capsule introduces the KATE-PD (KAhramanmaras Türkiye Earthquake
  Post Disaster) dataset, a valuable resource for the remote sensing and disaster
  response community. KATE-PD provides detailed annotations of collapsed buildings
  over a 3,293 square kilometer area, based on multi-source high-resolution satellite
  imagery—offering a level of detail that complements and expands upon existing datasets.
  This dataset is particularly crucial for machine learning algorithms focused on
  damage detection from single post-earthquake images, enhancing the ability to assess
  damage quickly and accurately.
